# Image Classification Using Hand-crafted and Deep Learning Neural Networks
This project involves the implementation of both manually designed fully-connected neural networks and modern deep learning architectures for image classification of three types of fruits: carambola, lychee, and pear. The study compares the performance of traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models with more advanced Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), analyzing their effectiveness in recognizing and classifying fruit images. Through this comparison, we aim to explore the trade-offs between model complexity and classification accuracy across different network structures.
